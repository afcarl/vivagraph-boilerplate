# Vivagraph Boilerplate

Basic boilerplate code and server to get started with VivagraphJS

# Getting started
- Download or Clone this repo `git clone https://github.com/joerodrig3/vivagraph-boilerplate.git`
- Navigate to the folder in your filesystem
- Run the node server typing `node app.js` in your CLI
- Navigate to `localhost:3000` to see a working demo

# Usage and Limitations
This is a very barebones implementation of VivaGraph meant for simple experiments and
not a production ready application.
To get started, you can modify the `demo.js` file located in `public/javascripts`.
Modifications there will be visible when you boot your server.

Vivagraph is loaded into the global namespace via the `index.html` file.  This
allows you to quickly experiment and debug problems via a Web Inspector in your
browser.
